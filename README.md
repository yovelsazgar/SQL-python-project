# SQL-python-project
General Description
We want to build software that manages supermarket chains, called BGU Mart. The software should support managing a large number of employees and the buying/selling of products. The software should also manage the inventory and thus contact various suppliers, who supply products. Sells and deliveries of products should be also registered and logged for tax purposes.

We need your help to build the software by implementing a tool using Python and SQLite.
The objective of this project is to design a sqlite3 database that will hold the employee, supplier, product, branch, and activity tables.
The database filename will be bgumart.db.
Contains 3 Python modules: initiate.py, action.py, and printdb.py.

The Database Structure:
The database bgumart.db has five tables:
Employees: This table holds information about the employees.
Suppliers: This table holds information about the suppliers.
Products: This table holds information about the products.
Branches: This table holds information about the branches.
Activities: This table holds information about all activities of the chain including sales and deliveries.
